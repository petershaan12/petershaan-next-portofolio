## ðŸš¨ Tentang Repo ini (About This Repo)

Haii ðŸ‘‹ you can use this code for your own website, but please dont forget me for copyright ðŸ˜Š.

Please note that the design of the website is inspired from "https://fahreziadha.com/", but didn't copied all the code, However, i built the portfolio from scratch with `Next JS` and `Tailwind CSS`  and i added some other functionalities to it, so it might seems the same, but believe me i did a lot of work the code, website and how it works is entirely different!!!!. If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Next.js DOCS](https://nextjs.org/docs) same thing for Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion check out the Documentation, Or you can simply reach to me directly.
